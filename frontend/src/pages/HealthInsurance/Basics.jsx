  { term: 'Copay', definition: 'The percentage of the claim amount you pay from your pocket. A 10% copay on a ₹1L bill means you pay ₹10,000. Look for plans with zero copay.' },
  { term: 'Waiting Period', definition: 'The initial period (usually 30 days for non-accidents, 2–4 years for pre-existing conditions) during which claims are not covered.' },
  { term: 'Room Rent Limit', definition: 'A cap on the daily room charge the insurer will cover. If your room costs more, all related expenses are reduced proportionally. Best plans have no room rent limit.' },
  { term: 'Cashless Treatment', definition: 'Treatment at a network hospital where the insurer pays the hospital directly. You don’t need to arrange funds upfront.' },
  { term: 'Restoration Benefit', definition: 'If your sum insured is exhausted, the insurer restores it (fully or partially) for subsequent claims in the same year. Unlimited restoration is ideal.' },
  { term: 'Sub-Limits', definition: 'Caps on specific treatments or expenses within your sum insured. For example, a ₹5,000 limit on ambulance charges. Fewer sub-limits = better plan.' },
  { term: 'No Claim Bonus', definition: 'A reward for not making claims. Your sum insured increases (typically 10–50%) for each claim-free year, without extra premium.' },

              <p className="text-brand-text-secondary leading-relaxed mb-4">
                Health insurance is a contract between you and an insurance company. You pay a yearly premium, and in return, the insurer covers your medical expenses — hospitalization, surgeries, day-care procedures, and sometimes even outpatient costs.
              </p>
              <p className="text-brand-text-secondary leading-relaxed mb-4">
                With medical inflation in India running at 14% annually, a single hospitalization can easily cost ₹5–10 lakhs in a metro city. Without insurance, this can wipe out years of savings.

                    <strong>Key fact:</strong> 65% of out-of-pocket medical expenses in India are paid by individuals without insurance. A comprehensive health plan starting at ₹10,000–15,000/year can protect your family from financial medical crises.
